When running configure with user-local libraries (boost or xerces), use
environment variables LIBRARY_PATH, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and compiler/linker
variables CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS as follows:

> LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/install/lib CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/install/include ./configure --prefix=$HOME/projects/aibot/tools/aibot/build CFLAGS=-I$HOME/install/include CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/install/include LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/install/lib

Then make as follows:

> make install
