These are the include files

If you just want to use Rebecca's api you will only
need the include files in the [rebecca] directory
and *NONE* of the files in any subdirectories.

If you are using both the api and the framework, you
will need the include files in the [rebecca] and 
[framework] subdirectory and *NONE* of the other 
subdirectories.

If you are trying to (re)build rebecca core engine and 
dll's from scratch you will need all these files and 
subdirectories.
