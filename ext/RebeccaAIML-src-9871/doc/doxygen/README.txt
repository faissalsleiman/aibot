This is where all the doxygen documents are at.
Doxygen is a documentation system for C++.  You 
can find more out about it at: 
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

[api]  This is where the doxygen for just the api 
       documents are.  Use this if you only want to
       know about using the api to RebeccaAIML.

[api+samples]  This is where the doxygen for the 
       api and the samples that go along with the 
       api are.  Use this if you only want to know
       about using the api to RebeccaAIML and you 
       want to see the doxygen of the samples as well.

[api+framework]  This is where the doxygen for the 
       api and the framework are.  Use this if you
       want to know about using the api as well as 
       extending, changing, or adding AIML XML Tags
       by inheriting and using the framework.
