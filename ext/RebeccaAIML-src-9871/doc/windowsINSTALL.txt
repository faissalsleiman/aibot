* STANDARD EASIEST WAY

These are simple instructions on how to make a build 
from the source code.

Pre-reqs
========

You need to install Boost 1.33.1 and Xerces 2.6.0. 

Define the following enviornment variables: 

BOOST_INCLUDE  -- Define this to be the directory of 
                  the boost include files.

XERCES_INCLUDE -- Define this to be the directory of 
                  the xerces include files.

BOOST_LIB      -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the BOOST compiled release libs 

BOOST_LIBD     -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the BOOST complied debug libs.

XERCES_LIB     -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the XERCES compiled release libs.

XERCES_LIBD    -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the XERCES compiled debug libs.

Put the xerces dll xerces-c_2_6.dll into the 
[bin\release] directory of Rebecca and the 
debuggable of xerces-c_2_6D.dll into 
[bin\debug]

Open up the visual studio solution: 

build_files\vs7_dll\rebecca.sln 

Then do a rebuild all for either release or debug
and you should be good to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the same steps outlined above to first setup your 
enviornment.

To build the regression test suite, open 
[build_files\vs7_tests\regression\regression.vcproj

Then do a rebuild all for either release or debug
and you should be good to go.

* DARING AUTOBUILD FROM A BATCH FILE WAY

If you're daring and you have doxygen installed 
and want to automatically create the distribution
for a version:

Change your working directory to
[build_files\vs7_build_bin_dist]

and exectute build_dist.bat to create a distribution
of RebeccaAIML into C:\
